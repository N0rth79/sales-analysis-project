# Sales Analysis Project

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to analyze sales data from a Chinese pharmaceutical retail chain company to uncover key insights into sales performance, profitability, and operational efficiencies. The analysis will focus on various metrics such as gross margin, net profit, operational expenses, and more.

The original dataset is in Chinese, so I have translated the column names and comments into English for this project.

### 1.1 Background

The dataset encompasses sales data from a Chinese pharmaceutical retail chain, which operates 20 stores. This dataset spans from January 2020 to September 2023, covering a period marked by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The company's product range is diverse, including prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, and various health products. Notably, this is the first instance of the company undertaking a comprehensive data analysis endeavor. Prior to this, there was no systematic analysis conducted on the accumulated sales data, leaving a significant opportunity to derive actionable insights from this untapped resource.The dataset encompasses sales data from a Chinese pharmaceutical retail chain, which operates 20 stores.

### 1.2 Objectives

The primary objective of this analysis is to delve into the sales data post the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on understanding how external events and market dynamics during this period have influenced sales patterns. Specific goals include:

1. **Trend Analysis**: To analyze sales trends since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying key periods of change and their potential correlation with pandemic-related events.
2. **Strategic Insights**: To combine the sales data analysis with real-world events, aiming to provide strategic recommendations on how the company can adapt to the post-pandemic market environment.

Through this analysis, the aim is to not only offer a comprehensive overview of the company's sales trajectory during an unprecedented global event but also to equip the company with data-driven insights for strategic decision-making in a post-COVID era.

## 2. Data Description

### 2.1 Data Source and Cleaning Process

1. **Source**: The sales data are sourced directly from the company's internal sales system, while the office, heating, and rental expenses are provided by the finance department. Both sets of data are in standard spreadsheet format but required cleaning for optimal use.

2. **Data Privacy and Anonymization**: Due to privacy concerns, the original data cannot be shared publicly. I have provided a cleansed version of the data, in which random variables have been added to the sales data for anonymization purposes.
